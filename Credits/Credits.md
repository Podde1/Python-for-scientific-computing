To obtain a certificate/credit, we expect you to follow the 4 days of the course and provide us with at least the following 5 documents via email (1 text document, 4 or more python scripts).
	
For each of the 4 days, write a short paragraph (learning diary) to highlight your personal reflections about what you have found useful, which topic inspired you to go deeper, and more in general what you liked and what could be improved.

For each of the 4 days: take one code example and make sure you can run it locally. Modify it a bit according to what inspires you: adding more comments, testing the code with different inputs, expanding it with something related to your field of research. There is no right or wrong way of doing this, but please submit a python script that we are eventually able to run and test on our local computers.

Please note that we do not track course attendance and if you missed one session, recordings will be available on Twitch immediately after the streaming ends.
